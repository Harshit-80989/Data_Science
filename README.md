# 📊 300 Days of Data Science Challenge

Welcome to my journey through the **#300DaysOfDataScience** challenge! 🚀  
This repository documents my daily progress as I explore the vast and exciting world of data science — from the basics of Python and data wrangling to the cutting-edge world of GenAI and LLMs.

## 🧠 What I'm Learning

Over the next 300 days, I’ll be posting what i learned on Linkedin and upload it on this repository:

### 🔹 Foundations
- Python Programming for Data Science
- Core Math for ML (Linear Algebra, Calculus, Statistics, Probability)
- Data Structures & Algorithms (as needed)

### 🔹 Data Handling & Visualization
- NumPy & Pandas for Data Manipulation
- SQL for Data Querying
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for Data Visualization

### 🔹 Machine Learning
- ML Workflow: Cleaning → Training → Evaluating
- Supervised & Unsupervised Learning
- Scikit-Learn and Model Selection

### 🔹 Deep Learning
- Neural Networks with TensorFlow / PyTorch
- CNNs, RNNs, Transfer Learning
- Model Deployment and Evaluation

### 🔹 GenAI & LLMs
- Prompt Engineering Basics
- Working with OpenAI APIs and LangChain
- Fine-tuning LLMs (LoRA, QLoRA, etc.)
- Building GenAI-powered apps

⭐ Goals
Build a solid portfolio of 10+ mini projects

Publish 50+ Jupyter notebooks

Learn to deploy ML/DL models

Contribute to open-source

Stay consistent, curious, and collaborative 💪
